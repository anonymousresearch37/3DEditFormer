                <b>TL;DR:</b> We introduce <i><b>3DEditVerse</b></i>, the largest paired 3D editing benchmark, and propose <i><b>3DEditFormer</b></i>, a mask-free transformer enabling precise, consistent, and scalable 3D edits.

                3D editing—the task of locally modifying the geometry or appearance of a 3D asset—has wide applications in immersive content creation, digital entertainment, and AR/VR. However, unlike 2D editing, it remains challenging due to the need for cross-view consistency, structural fidelity, and fine-grained controllability. Existing approaches are often slow, prone to geometric distortions, or dependent on manual and accurate 3D masks that are error-prone and impractical.  To address these challenges, we advance both the data and model fronts. On the data side, we introduce <strong>3DEditVerse</strong>, the largest paired 3D editing benchmark to date, comprising 116,309 high-quality training pairs and 1,500 curated test pairs. Built through complementary pipelines of pose-driven geometric edits, foundation model-guided appearance edits, and human validation, 3DEditVerse ensures edit locality, multi-view consistency, and semantic alignment.  On the model side, we propose <strong>3DEditFormer</strong>, a 3D-structure-preserving conditional transformer. By enhancing image-to-3D generation with dual-guidance attention and time-adaptive gating, 3DEditFormer disentangles editable regions from preserved structure, enabling precise and consistent edits without requiring auxiliary 3D masks.  Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines both quantitatively and qualitatively, establishing a new standard for practical and scalable 3D editing. Dataset and code will be released.
